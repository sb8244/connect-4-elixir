# Connect 4

Fun little challenge to create connect 4 in elixir. Goals of it are:

- [x] Playable Connect 4 via CLI
- [x] Bonus: Playable Tic Tac Toe via ClI
- [ ] Bonus: AI as player 2
- [ ] Bonus: Web interface for games

This is a learning application for me in Elixir, so it probably is going to have
some hella jank in it.

## Run

Run this with `mix run --no-halt`
